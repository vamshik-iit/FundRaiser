"Fund Raiser" can be used to facilitate fundraising efforts or raise money for the benefit of the community and increase community participation in giving, in order to boost and stabilize the amount of donations that are received. The SDLC waterfall approach is used to create the information system "Fund Raiser".

There are three roles in this application: donor, admin, and user. By logging in initially, the admin may see the dashboard home page, process data, examine and process transaction reports, and process contribution transactions. Donors must log in before they may provide comments, see the dashboard main page, or make donations. The user may post new campaigns from the dashboard's main page.
